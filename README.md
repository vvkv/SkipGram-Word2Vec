# SkipGram Word2Vec

In this notebook, I learn how to use TensorFlow to implement the word2vec algorithm using the skip-gram architecture. By implementing this, I will learn about embedding words for use in natural language processing. This will come in handy when dealing with things like translations. This is a part of the Udacity "Foundations in Deep Learning Nanodegree"
